abstract = {1 Share on performance can be degraded by poor blood perfusion, ambient light, and, most importantly, motion artifacts (MA). 1 Many signal processing techniques have been proposed to remove the MA noise, including the ADI motion rejection and frequency tracking algorithm, by using a three-axis acceleration sensor placed close to the PPG sensor. When there is no motion, it is desirable to have an on-demand algorithm provide a fast and more accurate estimate of the HR to tracking algorithms. This article adapts the multiple signal classification (MUSIC) frequency estimation algorithm for high precision, on-demand HR estimation using the PPG signals from the wrist, using the ADI healthcare watch platform using the block diagram in Figure 1. The details of the figure will be explained in later sections. What Does a PPG Signal from ADI's Healthcare Watch Look Like? As light is emitted by the LED, blood levels and tissues absorb various amounts of photons, causing different detections sensed by the photode-tector. The photodetector measures the variations in blood pulsations and outputs a current that is then amplified and filtered for further analysis. analogdialogue.com Imagine a world in the next few decades where your grandchildren didn't know about the word hospital and all your health information was recorded and monitored remotely through sensors. Imagine your home equipped with different sensors to measure air quality, temperature, noise, light, and air pressure, and, based on your personal health information, systems adjust the relevant environmental parameters to optimize your well-being at home. Analog Devices holds a unique position to make this happen by providing sensors, software, and algorithms that complement each other, which increases its share of the digital health market.},
