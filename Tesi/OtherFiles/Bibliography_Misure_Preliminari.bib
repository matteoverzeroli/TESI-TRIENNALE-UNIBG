abstract = {1 Share on performance can be degraded by poor blood perfusion, ambient light, and, most importantly, motion artifacts (MA). 1 Many signal processing techniques have been proposed to remove the MA noise, including the ADI motion rejection and frequency tracking algorithm, by using a three-axis acceleration sensor placed close to the PPG sensor. When there is no motion, it is desirable to have an on-demand algorithm provide a fast and more accurate estimate of the HR to tracking algorithms. This article adapts the multiple signal classification (MUSIC) frequency estimation algorithm for high precision, on-demand HR estimation using the PPG signals from the wrist, using the ADI healthcare watch platform using the block diagram in Figure 1. The details of the figure will be explained in later sections. What Does a PPG Signal from ADI's Healthcare Watch Look Like? As light is emitted by the LED, blood levels and tissues absorb various amounts of photons, causing different detections sensed by the photode-tector. The photodetector measures the variations in blood pulsations and outputs a current that is then amplified and filtered for further analysis. analogdialogue.com Imagine a world in the next few decades where your grandchildren didn't know about the word hospital and all your health information was recorded and monitored remotely through sensors. Imagine your home equipped with different sensors to measure air quality, temperature, noise, light, and air pressure, and, based on your personal health information, systems adjust the relevant environmental parameters to optimize your well-being at home. Analog Devices holds a unique position to make this happen by providing sensors, software, and algorithms that complement each other, which increases its share of the digital health market.},

abstract = {The dicrotic notch is a prominent and distinctive feature of the pressure waveform in the central arteries. It is universally used to demarcate the end of systole and the beginning of diastole in these arteries. Despite its importance clinically, no physical mechanism for the formation of the dicrotic notch has been demonstrated convincingly. We first explore a mechanism based on the reflection of a backward wavefront from the aortic valve at the time of closure. This hypothesis is rejected on the basis of experimental evidence from measurements made in dogs. A new hypothesis is presented involving the acceleration of the aortic valve apparatus at the time of valve closure. This hypothesis is supported by new calculations of the acceleration of the aortic valve apparatus during the cardiac cycle based on computed tomography scans in man.},

	abstract = {In this paper, we proposed an effective method for detecting fiducial points in arterial blood pressure pulses. An arterial blood pressure pulse normally consists of onset, systolic peak and dicrotic notch. Detection of fiducial points in blood pressure pulses is a critical task and has many potential applications. The proposed method employs empirical wavelet transform for locating the systolic peak and onset of blood pressure pulse. The proposed method first estimates the fundamental frequency of blood pressure pulse using empirical wavelet transform and utilizes the combination of the blood pressure pulse and the estimated frequency for locating onset and systolic peak. For dicrotic notch detection, it utilizes the first-order difference of blood pressure pulse. The algorithm was validated on various open-source databases and was tested on a data set containing 12,230 beats. Two benchmark parameters such as sensitivity and positive predictivity were used for the performance evaluation. The comparison results for accuracy of the detection of systolic peak, onset and dicrotic notch are reported. The proposed method attained a sensitivity and positive predictivity of 99.95% and 99.97%, respectively, for systolic peaks. For onsets, it attained a sensitivity and predictivity of 99.88% and 99.92%, respectively. For dicrotic notches, a sensitivity and positive predictivity of 98.98% and 98.81% were achieved, respectively.},
