Cardiac and vessel structures can be studied from a mechanical point of view. In this chapter, the heart and blood vessels will be described anatomically, emphasizing their mechanical role.},

abstract = {Photoplethysmography (PPG) is a simple-to-perform vascular optics measurement technique that can detect blood volume changes in the microvascular bed of tissue. Beat-to-beat analysis of the PPG waveform enables the study of the variability of pulse features, such as the amplitude and the pulse arrival time (PAT), and when quantified in the time and frequency domains, has considerable potential to shed light on perfusion changes associated with peripheral arterial disease (PAD). In this pilot study, innovative multi-site bilateral finger and toe PPG recordings from 43 healthy control subjects and 31 PAD subjects were compared (recordings each at least five minutes, collected in a warm temperature-controlled room). Beat-to-beat normalized amplitude variability and PAT variability were then quantified in the time-domain using two simple statistical measures and in the frequency-domain bilaterally using magnitude squared coherence (MSC). Significantly reduced normalized amplitude variability (healthy control 0.0384 (interquartile range 0.0217–0.0744) vs. PAD 0.0160 (0.0080–0.0338) (p < 0.0001)) and significantly increased PAT variability (healthy control 0.0063 (0.0052–0.0086) vs. PAD 0.0093 (0.0078–0.0144) (p < 0.0001)) was demonstrated for the toe site in PAD using the time-domain analysis. Frequency-domain analysis demonstrated significantly lower MSC values across a range of frequency bands for PAD patients. These changes suggest a loss of right-to-left body side coherence and cardiovascular control in PAD. This study has also demonstrated the feasibility of using these measurement and analysis methods in studies investigating multi-site PPG variability for a wide range of cardiac and vascular patient groups.},

Blood flow is the amount of blood flowing through arteries or veins of the circulatory system. Impairment in the blood flow is an indicator of various diseases. Hence a simple, fast, accurate and non-invasive blood flow measurement technique is required for early detection of the diseases. This paper proposes a simple, accurate, non-invasive method to measure the blood flow related parameters using Photoplethysmography (PPG). The blood volume through the veins is measured by acquiring the PPG signal from the body and further analysing the signal to measure different parameters like heart rate, oxygen saturation level (SpO2) and the PPG values are further used for building a cuffless blood pressure measuring system using an Artificial Neural Networks (ANN) with the dataset obtained from Medical Information Mart for Intensive Care III (MIMIC III).},

abstract = {The measurement of blood pressure (BP) is critical to the treatment and management of many medical conditions. High blood pressure is associated with many chronic disease conditions, and is a major source of mortality and morbidity around the world. For outpatient care as well as general health monitoring, there is great interest in being able to accurately and frequently measure BP outside of a clinical setting, using mobile or wearable devices. One possible solution is photoplethysmography (PPG), which is most commonly used in pulse oximetry in clinical settings for measuring oxygen saturation. PPG technology is becoming more readily available, inexpensive, convenient, and easily integrated into portable devices. Recent advances include the development of smartphones and wearable devices that collect pulse oximeter signals. In this article, we review (i) the state-of-the-art and the literature related to PPG signals collected by pulse oximeters, (ii) various theoretical approaches that have been adopted in PPG BP measurement studies, and (iii) the potential of PPG measurement devices as a wearable application. Past studies on changes in PPG signals and BP are highlighted, and the correlation between PPG signals and BP are discussed. We also review the combined use of features extracted from PPG and other physiological signals in estimating BP. Although the technology is not yet mature, it is anticipated that in the near future, accurate, continuous BP measurements may be available from mobile and wearable devices given their vast potential.},

Recently, there has been much interest from numerous researchers around the globe to extract further valuable information from the PPG signal in addition to heart rate estimation and pulse oxymetry readings. PPG signal's second derivative wave contains important health-related information. Thus, analysis of this waveform can help researchers and clinicians to evaluate various cardiovascular-related diseases such as atherosclerosis and arterial stiffness. Moreover, investigating the second derivative wave of PPG signal can also assist in early detection and diagnosis of various cardiovascular illnesses that may possibly appear later in life. For early recognition and analysis of such illnesses, continuous and real-time monitoring is an important approach that has been enabled by the latest technological advances in sensor technology and wireless communications. The aim of this article is to briefly consider some of the current developments and challenges of wearable PPG-based monitoring technologies and then to discuss some of the potential applications of this technology in clinical settings.},

The embryonic heart rate is an important physiological variable used as an index reflecting the embryo's natural activity and is considered one of the most difficult parameters to measure. An acceptable measurement technique of embryonic heart rate should provide a reliable cardiac signal quality while maintaining adequate gas exchange through the eggshell during the incubation and embryonic developmental period. In this paper, we present a detailed design and methodology for a non-invasive photoplethysmography (PPG)-based prototype (Egg-PPG) for real-time and continuous monitoring of embryonic heart rate during incubation. An automatic embryonic cardiac wave detection algorithm, based on normalised spectral entropy, is described. The developed algorithm successfully estimated the embryonic heart rate with 98.7% accuracy. We believe that the system presented in this paper is a promising solution for non-invasive, real-time monitoring of the embryonic cardiac signal. The proposed system can be used in both experimental studies (e.g., developmental embryology and cardiovascular research) and in industrial incubation applications.},

Among these, both PhotoPlethysmoGraphy (PPG) and Electrocardiography (ECG) signals are those more employed. PPG signals are an emerging non-invasive measurement technique used to study blood volume pulsations through the detection and analysis of the back-scattered optical radiation coming from the skin. ECG is the process of recording the electrical activity of the heart over a period of time using electrodes placed on the skin. In the present paper we propose a physiological ECG/PPG “combo” pipeline using an innovative bio-inspired nonlinear system based on a reaction-diffusion mathematical model, implemented by means of the Cellular Neural Network (CNN) methodology, to filter PPG signal by assigning a recognition score to the waveforms in the time series. The resulting “clean” PPG signal exempts from distortion and artifacts is used to validate for diagnostic purpose an EGC signal simultaneously detected for a same patient. The multisite combo PPG-ECG system proposed in this work overpasses the limitations of the state of the art in this field providing a reliable system for assessing the above-mentioned physiological parameters and their monitoring over time for robust medical assessment. The proposed system has been validated and the results confirmed the robustness of the proposed approach.},

Camera-based photoplethysmographic (PPG) signals were measured at 46 healthy adults at center wavelengths of 580 nm (green), 675 nm (red), and 840 nm (near-infrared; NIR). Subjects had their faces recorded during normoxia and hypoxia and under gradual cooling. SpO2,cam estimates in Vis were based on the normalized ratio of camera-based PPG amplitudes in red over green light (RoG). SpO2,cam in Vis was validated against contact SpO2 (reference) and compared with SpO2,cam estimated using red-NIR wavelengths. An RoG-based calibration curve for SpO2 was determined based on data with a SpO2 range of 85–100%. We found an Arms∗ error of 2.9% (higher than the Arms∗ for SpO2,cam in red-NIR). Additional measurements on normoxic subjects under temperature cooling (from 21∘C to <15∘C) evidenced a significant bias of − 1.7, CI [− 2.7, − 0.7]%. It was also noted that SpO2,cam estimated at the cheeks was significantly biased (− 3.6, CI [− 5.7, − 1.5]%) with respect to forehead estimations.

First described in the 1930s, the technology behind the waveform is simple. Thewaveform, as displayed on themodern pulse oximeter, is an amplified and highly filtered measurement of light absorption by the local tissue over time. It is optimized by medical device manufacturers to accentuate its pulsatile components. Physiologically, it is the result of a complex, and not well understood, interaction between the cardiovascular, respiratory, and autonomic systems. Allmodernpulse oximeters extract and display the heart rate and oxygen saturation derived from the PPG measurements at multiple wavelengths. "As is," the PPG is an excellent monitor for cardiac arrhythmia, particularly when used in conjunction with the electrocardiogram( ECG).With slight modifications in the display of the PPG (either toa stripchart recorderor sloweddownonthemonitor screen), the PPG can be used to measure the ventilator-induced modulationswhich have been associated with hypovolemia. Research efforts are underway to analyze the PPGusing improved digital signal processing methods todevelopnewphysiologicparameters. It ishoped that when these newphysiologic parameters are combinedwith amore modern understanding of cardiovascular physiology (functional hemodynamics) the potential utility of the PPG will be expanded. The clinical researcher's objective is the use of the PPG to guide early goal-directed therapeutic interventions (fluid, vasopressors, and inotropes), in effect to extract from the simple PPG the information and therapeutic guidance thatwaspreviously only obtainable froman arterial pressure line and the pulmonary artery catheter.},

abstract = {Blood pressure (BP) is one of the important vital signs that need to be monitored for personal healthcare. Arterial blood pressure (BP) was estimated from pulse transit time (PTT) and PPG waveform. PTT is a time interval between an R-wave of electrocardiography (ECG) and a photoplethysmography (PPG) signal. This method does not require an aircuff and only a minimal inconvenience of attaching electrodes and LED/photo detector sensors on a subject. PTT computed between the ECG R-wave and the maximum first derivative PPG was strongly correlated with systolic blood pressure (SBP) (R=-0.712) compared with other PTT values, and the diastolic time proved to be appropriate for estimation diastolic blood pressure (DBP) (R=-0.764). The percent errors of SBP using the individual regression line (4-11%) were lower than those using the regression line obtained from all five subjects (9-14%). On the other hand, the DBP estimation did not show much difference between the individual regression (4-10%) and total regression line (6-10%). Our developed device had a total size of 7×13.5 cm and was operated by single 3-V battery. Biosignals can be measured for 72 h continuously without external interruptions. Through a serial network communication, an external personal computer can monitor measured waveforms in real time. Our proposed method can be used for non-constrained, thus continuous BP monitoring for the purpose of personal healthcare. {\textcopyright} 2008 Springer Science+Business Media, LLC.},

abstract = {A survey of the literature is presented that provides an analysis of the optical properties of human skin, with particular regard to their applications in medicine. Included is a description of the primary interactions of light with skin and how these are commonly estimated using radiative transfer theory (RTT). This is followed by analysis of measured RTT coefficients available in the literature. Orders of magnitude differences are found within published absorption and reduced-scattering coefficients. Causes for these discrepancies are discussed in detail, including contrasts between data acquired in vitro and in vivo. An analysis of the phase functions applied in skin optics, along with the remaining optical coefficients (anisotropy factors and refractive indices) is also included. The survey concludes that further work in the field is necessary to establish a definitive range of realistic coefficients for clinically normal skin.},
