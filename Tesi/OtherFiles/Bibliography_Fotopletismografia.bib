abstract = {To overcome a large DC offset, ambient light interference, and optical path variation, a robust PPG readout chip is fabricated using 0.13-$\mu$m CMOS process. Against the large DC offset, a saturation detection and current feedback method can compensate a current of up to 30 $\mu$A. To be robust against optical path variation, an automatic emitting light compensation method is adopted. To remove the ambient light interference, we propose an alternating sampling and charge redistribution technique, in which no additional power is consumed, and only three differential switches and one capacitor are required. The PPG readout channel consumes 26 $\mu$W and has a input referred current noise of 260 pArms.},

Previous studies demonstrated effects of temperature of the measurement environment; however, an integrated evaluation has not been established in environments with gradual air temperature variation. The purpose of this study is to investigate variations and relationships of blood pressure (BP), PPG and cardiovascular parameters such as heart rate (HR), stroke volume (SV), cardiac output (CO) and total peripheral resistance (TPR), by changing skin surface temperature (SST). Local mild cooling and heating was conducted on 16 healthy subjects. The results showed that local SST changes affected Finometer blood pressures (Finger BP), PPG components and TPR, but not the oscillometric blood pressure (Central BP), HR, SV and CO, and indicated that temperature must be maintained and monitored to reliably evaluate cardiovascular conditions in temperature-varying environments.},

abstract = {This paper proposes a cuFF-less systolic blood pressure (SBP) estimation method using partial least-squares (PLS) regression. Level-crossing features (LCFs) were used in this method, which were extracted from the contour lines arbitrarily drawn on the second-derivative photoplethysmography waveform. Unlike conventional height ratio features (HRFs), which are extracted on the basis of the peaks in the waveform, LCFs can be reliably extracted even if there are missing peaks in the waveform. However, the features extracted from adjacent contour lines show similar trends; thus, there is a strong correlation between the features, which leads to multicollinearity when conventional multiple regression analysis (MRA) is used. Hence, we developed a multivariate estimation method based on PLS regression to address this issue and estimate the SBP on the basis of the LCFs. Two-hundred-and-sixty-five subjects (95 males and 170 females [(Mean ± Standard Deviation) SBP: 133.1 ± 18.4 mmHg; age: 62.8 ± 16.8 years] participated in the experiments. Of the total number of subjects, 180 were considered as learning data, while 85 were considered as testing data. The values of the correlation coefficient between the measured and estimated values were found to be 0.78 for the proposed method (LCFs + PLS), 0.58 for comparison method 1 (HRFs + MRA), and 0.62 for comparison method 2 (HRFs + MRA). The proposed method was therefore found to demonstrate the highest accuracy among the three methods being compared.},

abstract = {Blood pressure (BP) is a direct indicator of hypertension, a dangerous and potentially deadly condition. Regular monitoring of BP is thus important, but many people have aversion towards cuff-based devices, and their limitation is that they can only be used at rest. Using just a photoplethysmogram (PPG) to estimate BP is a potential solution investigated in our study. We analyzed the MIMIC III database for high-quality PPG and arterial BP waveforms, resulting in over 700 h of signals after preprocessing, belonging to 510 subjects. We then used the PPG alongside its first and second derivative as inputs into a novel spectro-temporal deep neural network with residual connections. We have shown in a leave-one-subject-out experiment that the network is able to model the dependency between PPG and BP, achieving mean absolute errors of 9.43 for systolic and 6.88 for diastolic BP. Additionally we have shown that personalization of models is important and substantially improves the results, while deriving a good general predictive model is difficult. We have made crucial parts of our study, especially the list of used subjects and our neural network code, publicly available, in an effort to provide a solid baseline and simplify potential comparison between future studies on an explicit MIMIC III subset.},

abstract = {Photoplethysmography (PPG) is a simple and low-cost optical technique that can be used to detect blood volume changes in the microvascular bed of tissue. It is often used non-invasively to make measurements at the skin surface. The PPG waveform comprises a pulsatile ('AC') physiological waveform attributed to cardiac synchronous changes in the blood volume with each heart beat, and is superimposed on a slowly varying ('DC') baseline with various lower frequency components attributed to respiration, sympathetic nervous system activity and thermoregulation. Although the origins of the components of the PPG signal are not fully understood, it is generally accepted that they can provide valuable information about the cardiovascular system. There has been a resurgence of interest in the technique in recent years, driven by the demand for low cost, simple and portable technology for the primary care and community based clinical settings, the wide availability of low cost and small semiconductor components, and the advancement of computer-based pulse wave analysis techniques. The PPG technology has been used in a wide range of commercially available medical devices for measuring oxygen saturation, blood pressure and cardiac output, assessing autonomic function and also detecting peripheral vascular disease. The introductory sections of the topical review describe the basic principle of operation and interaction of light with tissue, early and recent history of PPG, instrumentation, measurement protocol, and pulse wave analysis. The review then focuses on the applications of PPG in clinical physiological measurements, including clinical physiological monitoring, vascular assessment and autonomic function. {\textcopyright} 2007 IOP Publishing Ltd.},

abstract = {Photoplethysmography (PPG) is a simple-to-perform vascular optics measurement technique that can detect blood volume changes in the microvascular bed of tissue. Beat-to-beat analysis of the PPG waveform enables the study of the variability of pulse features, such as the amplitude and the pulse arrival time (PAT), and when quantified in the time and frequency domains, has considerable potential to shed light on perfusion changes associated with peripheral arterial disease (PAD). In this pilot study, innovative multi-site bilateral finger and toe PPG recordings from 43 healthy control subjects and 31 PAD subjects were compared (recordings each at least five minutes, collected in a warm temperature-controlled room). Beat-to-beat normalized amplitude variability and PAT variability were then quantified in the time-domain using two simple statistical measures and in the frequency-domain bilaterally using magnitude squared coherence (MSC). Significantly reduced normalized amplitude variability (healthy control 0.0384 (interquartile range 0.0217–0.0744) vs. PAD 0.0160 (0.0080–0.0338) (p < 0.0001)) and significantly increased PAT variability (healthy control 0.0063 (0.0052–0.0086) vs. PAD 0.0093 (0.0078–0.0144) (p < 0.0001)) was demonstrated for the toe site in PAD using the time-domain analysis. Frequency-domain analysis demonstrated significantly lower MSC values across a range of frequency bands for PAD patients. These changes suggest a loss of right-to-left body side coherence and cardiovascular control in PAD. This study has also demonstrated the feasibility of using these measurement and analysis methods in studies investigating multi-site PPG variability for a wide range of cardiac and vascular patient groups.},

abstract = {Photoplethysmography (PPG) signals from the forehead can be used in pulse oximetry as they are less affected by vasoconstriction compared to fingers. However, the increase in venous blood caused by the positioning of the patient can deteriorate the signals and cause erroneous estimations of the arterial oxygen saturation. To date, there is no method to measure this venous presence under the PPG sensor. This study investigates the feasibility of using PPG signals from the forehead in an effort to estimate relative changes in haemoglobin concentrations that could reveal these posture-induced changes. Two identical reflectance PPG sensors were placed on two different positions on the forehead (above the eyebrow and on top of a large vein) in 16 healthy volunteers during a head-down tilt protocol. Relative changes in oxygenated (∆HbO2), reduced (∆HHb) and total (∆tHb) haemoglobin were estimated from the PPG signals and the trends were compared with reference Near Infrared Spectroscopy (NIRS) measurements. Also, the signals from the two PPG sensors were analysed in order to reveal any difference due to the positioning of the sensor. ∆HbO2, ∆HHb and ∆tHb estimated from the forehead PPGs trended well with the same parameters from the reference NIRS. However, placing the sensor over a large vasculature reduces trending against NIRS, introduces biases as well as increases the variability of the changes in ∆HHb. Forehead PPG signals can be used to measure perfusion changes to reveal venous pooling induced by the positioning of the subject. Placing the sensor above the eyebrow and away from large vasculature avoids biases and large variability in the measurements.},

The present work describes a simple design of a photoplethysmograph, using a wearable earlobe sensor. Beat-to-beat time intervals were evaluated as the time between subsequent pulses, thus generating a signal representative of heart rate variability, which was compared to RR intervals from classic electrocardiography. Twenty-minute pulse photoplethysmography and ECG recordings were taken simultaneously from 10 healthy individuals. Ten additional subjects were recorded for 24 h. Comparisons were made of raw signals and on time-domain and frequency-domain HRV parameters. There were small differences between the inter-beat intervals evaluated with the two techniques. The current findings suggest that our wearable earlobe pulse photoplethysmograph may be suitable for short and long-term home measuring and monitoring of HRV parameters.},

First described in the 1930s, the technology behind the waveform is simple. Thewaveform, as displayed on themodern pulse oximeter, is an amplified and highly filtered measurement of light absorption by the local tissue over time. It is optimized by medical device manufacturers to accentuate its pulsatile components. Physiologically, it is the result of a complex, and not well understood, interaction between the cardiovascular, respiratory, and autonomic systems. Allmodernpulse oximeters extract and display the heart rate and oxygen saturation derived from the PPG measurements at multiple wavelengths. "As is," the PPG is an excellent monitor for cardiac arrhythmia, particularly when used in conjunction with the electrocardiogram( ECG).With slight modifications in the display of the PPG (either toa stripchart recorderor sloweddownonthemonitor screen), the PPG can be used to measure the ventilator-induced modulationswhich have been associated with hypovolemia. Research efforts are underway to analyze the PPGusing improved digital signal processing methods todevelopnewphysiologicparameters. It ishoped that when these newphysiologic parameters are combinedwith amore modern understanding of cardiovascular physiology (functional hemodynamics) the potential utility of the PPG will be expanded. The clinical researcher's objective is the use of the PPG to guide early goal-directed therapeutic interventions (fluid, vasopressors, and inotropes), in effect to extract from the simple PPG the information and therapeutic guidance thatwaspreviously only obtainable froman arterial pressure line and the pulmonary artery catheter.},

abstract = {Remotely measuring the arterial blood oxygen saturation (SpO2) in visible light (Vis) involves different probing depths, which may compromise calibratibility. This paper assesses the feasibility of calibrating camera-based SpO2 (SpO2,cam) using red and green light. Camera-based photoplethysmographic (PPG) signals were measured at 46 healthy adults at center wavelengths of 580 nm (green), 675 nm (red), and 840 nm (near-infrared; NIR). Subjects had their faces recorded during normoxia and hypoxia and under gradual cooling. SpO2,cam estimates in Vis were based on the normalized ratio of camera-based PPG amplitudes in red over green light (RoG). SpO2,cam in Vis was validated against contact SpO2 (reference) and compared with SpO2,cam estimated using red-NIR wavelengths. An RoG-based calibration curve for SpO2 was determined based on data with a SpO2 range of 85–100%. We found an Arms∗ error of 2.9% (higher than the Arms∗ for SpO2,cam in red-NIR). Additional measurements on normoxic subjects under temperature cooling (from 21∘C to <15∘C) evidenced a significant bias of − 1.7, CI [− 2.7, − 0.7]%. It was also noted that SpO2,cam estimated at the cheeks was significantly biased (− 3.6, CI [− 5.7, − 1.5]%) with respect to forehead estimations. Under controlled conditions, SpO2,cam can be calibrated with red and green light but the accuracy is less than that of SpO2,cam estimated in the usual red-NIR window.},

abstract = {The measurement of blood pressure (BP) is critical to the treatment and management of many medical conditions. High blood pressure is associated with many chronic disease conditions, and is a major source of mortality and morbidity around the world. For outpatient care as well as general health monitoring, there is great interest in being able to accurately and frequently measure BP outside of a clinical setting, using mobile or wearable devices. One possible solution is photoplethysmography (PPG), which is most commonly used in pulse oximetry in clinical settings for measuring oxygen saturation. PPG technology is becoming more readily available, inexpensive, convenient, and easily integrated into portable devices. Recent advances include the development of smartphones and wearable devices that collect pulse oximeter signals. In this article, we review (i) the state-of-the-art and the literature related to PPG signals collected by pulse oximeters, (ii) various theoretical approaches that have been adopted in PPG BP measurement studies, and (iii) the potential of PPG measurement devices as a wearable application. Past studies on changes in PPG signals and BP are highlighted, and the correlation between PPG signals and BP are discussed. We also review the combined use of features extracted from PPG and other physiological signals in estimating BP. Although the technology is not yet mature, it is anticipated that in the near future, accurate, continuous BP measurements may be available from mobile and wearable devices given their vast potential.},

abstract = {Physiological signals are widely used to perform medical assessment for monitoring an extensive range of pathologies, usually related to cardio-vascular diseases. Among these, both PhotoPlethysmoGraphy (PPG) and Electrocardiography (ECG) signals are those more employed. PPG signals are an emerging non-invasive measurement technique used to study blood volume pulsations through the detection and analysis of the back-scattered optical radiation coming from the skin. ECG is the process of recording the electrical activity of the heart over a period of time using electrodes placed on the skin. In the present paper we propose a physiological ECG/PPG “combo” pipeline using an innovative bio-inspired nonlinear system based on a reaction-diffusion mathematical model, implemented by means of the Cellular Neural Network (CNN) methodology, to filter PPG signal by assigning a recognition score to the waveforms in the time series. The resulting “clean” PPG signal exempts from distortion and artifacts is used to validate for diagnostic purpose an EGC signal simultaneously detected for a same patient. The multisite combo PPG-ECG system proposed in this work overpasses the limitations of the state of the art in this field providing a reliable system for assessing the above-mentioned physiological parameters and their monitoring over time for robust medical assessment. The proposed system has been validated and the results confirmed the robustness of the proposed approach.},

abstract = {The chicken embryo is a widely used experimental animal model in many studies, including in the field of developmental biology, of the physiological responses and adaptation to altered environments, and for cancer and neurobiology research. The embryonic heart rate is an important physiological variable used as an index reflecting the embryo's natural activity and is considered one of the most difficult parameters to measure. An acceptable measurement technique of embryonic heart rate should provide a reliable cardiac signal quality while maintaining adequate gas exchange through the eggshell during the incubation and embryonic developmental period. In this paper, we present a detailed design and methodology for a non-invasive photoplethysmography (PPG)-based prototype (Egg-PPG) for real-time and continuous monitoring of embryonic heart rate during incubation. An automatic embryonic cardiac wave detection algorithm, based on normalised spectral entropy, is described. The developed algorithm successfully estimated the embryonic heart rate with 98.7% accuracy. We believe that the system presented in this paper is a promising solution for non-invasive, real-time monitoring of the embryonic cardiac signal. The proposed system can be used in both experimental studies (e.g., developmental embryology and cardiovascular research) and in industrial incubation applications.},

abstract = {In our daily life, sensors are corporate in several devices and applications for a better life. Such sensors as the tactile sensors are included in the touch screens and the computers' touch pads. The input of these sensors is from the environment that converted into an electrical signal for further processing in the sensor system. The sensor's main role is to measure a specific quantity and create a signal for interpretation. The human bodies continuously communicate health information that reflects the status of the body organs and the overall health information. Such information is typically captured by physical devices that measure different types of information, such as measuring the brain activity, blood glucose, blood pressure, heart rate, nerve conduction, and so forth. According to these measurements, physicians decide the diagnosis and treatment decisions. Engineers are realizing new acquiring devices to measure noninvasively the different types of signals for further analysis using mathematical algorithms and formulae. This chapter includes classifications of the biosignals based on several principles. In addition, the different biosensors are highlighted including the role of the biopotential amplifier stage within the sensor system. Finally, the biomedical signal acquisition and processing phases are also included.},

abstract = {Blood pressure (BP) is one of the important vital signs that need to be monitored for personal healthcare. Arterial blood pressure (BP) was estimated from pulse transit time (PTT) and PPG waveform. PTT is a time interval between an R-wave of electrocardiography (ECG) and a photoplethysmography (PPG) signal. This method does not require an aircuff and only a minimal inconvenience of attaching electrodes and LED/photo detector sensors on a subject. PTT computed between the ECG R-wave and the maximum first derivative PPG was strongly correlated with systolic blood pressure (SBP) (R=-0.712) compared with other PTT values, and the diastolic time proved to be appropriate for estimation diastolic blood pressure (DBP) (R=-0.764). The percent errors of SBP using the individual regression line (4-11%) were lower than those using the regression line obtained from all five subjects (9-14%). On the other hand, the DBP estimation did not show much difference between the individual regression (4-10%) and total regression line (6-10%). Our developed device had a total size of 7×13.5 cm and was operated by single 3-V battery. Biosignals can be measured for 72 h continuously without external interruptions. Through a serial network communication, an external personal computer can monitor measured waveforms in real time. Our proposed method can be used for non-constrained, thus continuous BP monitoring for the purpose of personal healthcare. {\textcopyright} 2008 Springer Science+Business Media, LLC.},

Included is a description of the primary interactions of light with skin and how these are commonly estimated using radiative transfer theory (RTT). This is followed by analysis of measured RTT coefficients available in the literature. Orders of magnitude differences are found within published absorption and reduced-scattering coefficients. Causes for these discrepancies are discussed in detail, including contrasts between data acquired in vitro and in vivo. An analysis of the phase functions applied in skin optics, along with the remaining optical coefficients (anisotropy factors and refractive indices) is also included. The survey concludes that further work in the field is necessary to establish a definitive range of realistic coefficients for clinically normal skin.},
